This library is P/Invoke wrapper for serial port.
Originally copied from http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc301786.aspx that I guess licensed under Ms-PL so this project will be also in Ms-PL.
Please help me on completing APIs of this library, any suggestion is valued :)
I am trying to make this library more similar with System.IO.Ports.SerialPort.

Have fun :)
