This library is a P/Invoke wrapper for Win32API serial port.
Originally copied from http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc301786.aspx that I guess licensed under Ms-PL so this project will be also in Ms-PL.
Please help me on completing APIs of this library, any suggestion is valued :)
I am trying to make this library more similar with System.IO.Ports.SerialPort.

It useful in cases System.IO.Ports.SerialPort is not working well (for connecting to \\.\... devices)

For having this library, you can download PInvokeSerialPort.dll or just simply download it from nuget (https://nuget.org/packages/PInvokeSerialPort) :)
